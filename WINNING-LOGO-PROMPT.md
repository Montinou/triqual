## SECONDARY PROMPT (Enhanced Detail Version)

```
Design a sophisticated logo mark featuring a three-sided Möbius strip as the central metaphor for continuous, infinite learning and testing cycles.

CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION:
The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface with only one side and one boundary. A three-sided variant represents three distinct components (Quoth pattern documentation, Exolar analytics, Playwright execution) that flow together as one unified, continuous system. The impossible geometry suggests paradigm-shifting intelligence and endless improvement cycles.

VISUAL EXECUTION:
Create three flowing ribbons that twist through space in a Möbius configuration:
1. Start with three separate ribbon paths positioned at 120° intervals
2. Each ribbon twists 180° as it loops back to its origin
3. The ribbons appear to pass through each other at impossible angles
4. Where ribbons intersect/blend, create subtle color fusion (cyan+lime=teal, lime+magenta=amber, magenta+cyan=purple)
5. Ribbon edges have subtle highlights (white, 20% opacity) on top edge and shadows (black, 15% opacity) on bottom edge
6. The overall form creates a trefoil knot appearance with continuous flow

COLOR IMPLEMENTATION:
- Cyan ribbon (#00D9FF): Technology, clarity, precision (represents Playwright test execution)
- Lime ribbon (#7FFF00): Growth, vitality, continuous action (represents Quoth pattern learning)
- Magenta ribbon (#FF006E): Transformation, energy, insight (represents Exolar analytics)
- Gold accent (#FFD700): Appears where all three colors converge at center, suggesting unified quality
- Use gradient mesh for smooth color transitions along each ribbon length
- Maintain color saturation even at small sizes

DIMENSIONAL DEPTH:
- Ribbons have 3D tube-like appearance with subtle gradient shading
- Light source from top-left creates consistent highlights
- Shadow depth suggests ribbons floating above background
- Avoid excessive depth that looks "plasticky" - aim for refined sophistication
- Inner edges slightly darker, outer edges slightly lighter

MATHEMATICAL PRECISION:
- Möbius strip follows true topological path (trace one surface, return to start)
- Ribbon width consistent throughout (no pinching or expanding)
- Curves follow Bézier principles for smooth, elegant flow
- 120° rotational symmetry for balanced composition
- Central convergence point is mathematically precise intersection

BRAND POSITIONING:
- Premium positioning: comparable to Stripe, Vercel, Linear in design quality
- Technical credibility: appeals to engineers who recognize mathematical sophistication
- Timeless aesthetic: will remain relevant in 10+ years
- Memorable distinctiveness: "the impossible loop" becomes brand shorthand
- Enterprise trust: sophisticated without being cold or corporate

USAGE CONTEXTS (Design Accordingly):
- App icon (512x512px): Bold, clear ribbon definition
- Favicon (32x32px, 16x16px): Simplified with thicker ribbons for clarity
- Documentation header (800x200px): Horizontal orientation possible
- Marketing materials: Animated version shows ribbon tracing infinite path
- Dark mode (primary): Neon colors on dark navy (#1A1A2E)
- Light mode (variant): Adjusted saturation for white backgrounds

EMOTIONAL RESONANCE:
The logo should evoke:
- Curiosity ("How does this work?")
- Intelligence ("This team understands complex systems")
- Continuity ("Testing never ends, always improving")
- Sophistication ("Premium product, not commodity")
- Trust ("Mathematical precision = reliable automation")

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Minimum stroke weight: 2px (at any scale)
- Maximum colors in gradient: 5 per ribbon
- Anti-aliasing: Full (not pixel-perfect geometric)
- Color profile: sRGB for screen, CMYK variant for print
- Transparency: Logo works on any dark background (navy, black, dark gray)
```

## ANIMATION SPECIFICATIONS (Future)

**For interactive/video contexts:**

- Colors pulse gently (breathing effect, 3-second cycle)
- Rotation: Slow clockwise spin (20-second full rotation)
- Particle effect: Small dots travel along ribbon path

---

## BRAND STORY (For Context)

**Triqual Philosophy:**
Testing is not a linear process with a beginning and end. It's a continuous Möbius loop where patterns inform execution, execution generates data, data reveals new patterns, and the cycle repeats infinitely. The three components (Quoth, Exolar, Playwright) are mathematically inseparable—remove any one, and the unified intelligence collapses.

The Möbius Trinity Loop visualizes this philosophy: three distinct ribbons that are actually one continuous surface, flowing endlessly without orientation or termination.

## REMOVE BACKGROUND INSTRUCTION

After generation, remove the solid background:
1. Export logo with transparent background (PNG-24 with alpha channel)
2. Ensure ribbons have clean anti-aliased edges against transparency
3. Verify no background color remnants around ribbon edges
4. Test on multiple background colors (dark navy, black, white) for compatibility
5. Provide both "on navy" and "transparent" versions
